# task_master
My custom tool for keeping track of notes and tasks to do.
  - There is a memory feature for keeping track of tasks after closing the program. Memory will be stored in the same directory as the executable in a file called 'memory.txt'

To make changes: Modify the task_master.py file and run the create_exe.py file.
  - Note: This will make a 'dist' and 'build' directory, open the 'dist' directory to get your custom executable

To use default: Take the .exe and run it
